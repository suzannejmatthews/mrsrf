#summary Explains how to compile and use MrsRF.

= Introduction =

MrsRF is a multi-core algorithm utilizing MapReduce to calculate large Robinson Foulds(RF) distance matrices. 

The input to MrsRF is a NewickTree file containing _t_ trees. The output is a _t x t_ distance matrix.


=== To compile ===
From the home directory:
  * `cd` into the `src\` directory. Type `make` to make all the executables. 
  * `cd` into the `hashbase\` directory. Type `./configure` followed by `make`.
This will create all the executables necessary for MrsRF to work.

=== List of Created Executables === 
In `src\`:
  * `mrsrf`
    * Works on _k_ nodes to create a _t x t_ matrix.
    * Calls `mrsrf-pq` to create RF submatrices. 
  * `mrsrf-pq`
    * Used in conjunction with `mrsrf`.
    * Creates a matrix of size _p x q_.
